A Python-based steganography tool designed to securely conceal data within images by leveraging AES encryption and OpenCV. This project integrates cryptographic methods with steganographic techniques, ensuring confidential information stays hidden and difficult to detect. It offers a discreet approach to secure digital communication.

StegoShield: Advanced Image Steganography 🔒🖼️
A Python-powered tool for embedding confidential data inside images using AES encryption and OpenCV. This ensures that sensitive messages remain protected and can only be accessed by authorized individuals.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Enhanced Security – Combines AES encryption and steganography for strong data protection.
✅ Stealth Mode – Embeds data with minimal visual distortion, making it hard to detect.
✅ Broad Compatibility – Supports PNG, JPEG, BMP formats.
✅ Multi-Platform Support – Works on Kali Linux, with adaptability for Windows and macOS.
✅ Secure Data Retrieval – Only those with the correct decryption key can extract hidden messages.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, Stegano, Cryptography, NumPy, PIL (Pillow)
Tools: Kali Linux, Steghide, OpenStego
Encryption Standard: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
📌 How It Works
Encrypt the Message – The secret text is encrypted using AES before embedding.
Hide in Image – The encrypted message is discreetly inserted into an image file.
Share Securely – The modified image appears unchanged, preventing suspicion.
Extract & Decrypt – The receiver retrieves and decrypts the message using the appropriate script and key.
Workflow Example:
📷 Original Image → 🔐 Embed Message with Script → 🖼️ Modified Image (Visually Identical) → 🔎 Extraction Process → 🔓 Decrypted Secret Message

📌 Setup & Installation Guide
🔧 Prerequisites
1️⃣ Install Python
Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Get it from:
🔗 Python Official Site

Check installation by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
python --version
2️⃣ Install Required Dependencies
Install all necessary libraries with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python numpy pillow cryptography stegano
Or install them one by one:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python    # Image processing  
pip install numpy            # Data manipulation  
pip install pillow           # Image handling  
pip install cryptography     # AES encryption  
pip install stegano          # Steganography processing  
3️⃣ Optional Tools for Extra Functionality
To extend capabilities, install additional steganography tools:

🔹 For Kali Linux Users:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt install steghide
steghide – Useful for alternative data hiding techniques.
🔹 For Windows Users:

Install OpenStego – A GUI-based steganography tool.
📥 Cloning the Project
Download the repository locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <GitHub_Repo_Link>
cd <Repo_Folder_Name>
▶️ Running the Project
1️⃣ Conceal a Secret Message in an Image
bash
Copy
Edit
python hide_message.py
This script securely embeds a hidden message inside an image.
2️⃣ Retrieve the Hidden Message
bash
Copy
Edit
python extract_message.py
Extracts and decrypts the concealed message from the image.
💡 Ensure you have an image file ready before embedding!

🚀 Ready to Go!
You can now securely hide and extract messages inside images using this tool.
